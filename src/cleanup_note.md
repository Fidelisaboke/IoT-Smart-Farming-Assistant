# Project Structure Cleanup Complete

The project structure has been cleaned up with the following changes:

## Changes Made:
1. **Updated root App.tsx**: Now properly imports from `/src/components/` instead of being a placeholder
2. **Maintained proper Vite structure**: All active components are in `/src/components/`
3. **Duplicate directory remains**: The old `/components/` directory contains outdated versions

## Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Remove old `/components/` directory**: You can safely delete this directory as all components are now properly located in `/src/components/`
2. **Remove unused files**: Clean up any backup files like `App.tsx.backup`
3. **Remove `/gitignore/` directory**: This appears to contain old component files that are no longer needed

## Current Active Structure:
- Main app: `/App.tsx` (imports from `/src/components/`)
- Vite entry: `/src/App.tsx` (imports from `./components/`)
- Components: `/src/components/` (all active components)
- UI Components: `/src/components/ui/` (shadcn components)
- Styles: `/styles/globals.css`

## File Cleanup Commands:
You can run these commands to clean up:
```bash
rm -rf /components
rm -rf /gitignore
rm App.tsx.backup
rm cleanup_note.md
```
